This repository contains C# interactive notebooks that demonstrate how to use the Carbon cross-tabulation library API. The notebooks can be opened by [Visual Studio Code][vscode] and they provide a rich interactive experience using a mixture of code and formatted commentary text.

C# interactive notebooks can be used for educational purposes, and they can used to compose and run production quality data processing scripts.

Many [introductory Videos][vsintro] are available online.

The notebook file names have numbered prefixes as a hint to the order in which they should be used as tutorials about the Carbon API.
