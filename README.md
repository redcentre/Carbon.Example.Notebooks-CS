### Overview

This repository contains C# interactive notebooks that demonstrate how to use the Carbon cross-tabulation library API. The notebooks can be opened by [Visual Studio Code][vscode] and they provide a rich interactive experience using a mixture of code and formatted commentary text.

C# interactive notebooks can be used for educational purposes, and they can used to compose and run production quality data processing scripts.

Many [introductory Videos][vsintro] are available online.

The notebook file names have numbered prefixes as a hint to the order in which they should be used as tutorials about the Carbon API.

### Contents

* **01 Simple Report**  
  Shows the minimum code required to generate a simple cross-tabulation report in comma separated format. It explains the *boilerplate* code that is normally at the start and end of Carbon library processing.

* **02 Report to DataFrames and Chart**  
  Generates a report as a [DataFrame][msdf] which is input to the [Plotly.NET][plotly] library to generate attractive charts.
