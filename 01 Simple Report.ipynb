    "This example notebook demonstrates the basic code required to use the Carbon cross-tabulation libraries to create a report. This notebook is a good place to start if you haven't used Carbon before. The code is separated into cells with their own explanations. In other notebooks, the repetitive *startup* code explained once in this notebook is simply placed in the first cell with the assumption that its purpose is understood.\n",
